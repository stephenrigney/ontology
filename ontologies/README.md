## Oireachtas Ontology — Structure and Contents

The ontology is split into six sub-ontologies, each covering one of the four declared areas of the Oireachtas ontology, plus a shared controlled vocabulary layer and a detailed membership model. A root umbrella file imports all six.

### agents.owl

**IRI:** `https://data.oireachtas.ie/ontology/agents`

Defines the organisations, roles and persons involved in the legislative process.

> **ELI-DL alignment (2026):** `eli-dl` import added. `:BillSource` class and `:Mover` class eliminated. `:Government`, `:PrivateMember` and `:PrivateSponsor` no longer subclasses of `:BillSource`. Canonical submitter linking now via `eli-dl:was_submitted_by`. Activity-level participation (e.g. who moved a bill) now via `eli-dl:had_participation` with `eli-dl:ParticipationRole` individuals defined in `members.owl`.
>
> **Namespace reconciliation (2026):** `foaf:Person` added as second superclass on `:Member` alongside `rda:C10004` (required for ELI-DL `eli:Person` range entailment via `eli:Person rdfs:subClassOf foaf:Person`).
>
> **RDA cleanup (2026):** `rda:C10005` removed as superclass of `:Oireachtas` (retains `org:FormalOrganization`). `rda:C10004` removed as superclass of `:Member` (retains `foaf:Person`, the direct superclass satisfying ELI-DL entailments). `rda:C10004` + `rda:C10005` removed from `:PrivateSponsor` (replaced with `foaf:Agent` — the common FOAF supertype covering both individual and corporate sponsors; already in the import chain via ELI-DL). The RDA namespace is no longer referenced anywhere in the ontology.
>
> **House / HouseTerm refactoring (2026):** `:Chamber` renamed to `:House` (continuous constitutional institution). Former `:House` (bounded sitting period) renamed to `:HouseTerm`. Two disjoint subclasses `:DailTerm` and `:SeanadTerm` added under `:HouseTerm`. Named individuals `<.../house/dail>` and `<.../house/seanad>` now typed `:House`. The `:hasTerm` / `:termOf` property pair updated accordingly.
>
> **Government three-tier refactoring (2026):** `:Government` gains `skos:altLabel "Cabinet"@en` and an updated `rdfs:comment` explaining the constitutional basis and three-tier structure. See `members.owl` for the new `:GovernmentBenches`, `:GovernmentExecutive` and `:MinisterOfState` classes.
>
> **bill.json alignment (2026):** Named individuals `<.../def/bill-source/government>` (typed `:Government`) and `<.../def/bill-source/private-member>` (typed `:PrivateMember`) added using the API `def/` URIs directly as IRIs, so `eli-dl:was_submitted_by` can point straight at the dereferenceable URI from the JSON. `:hasCommitteeType` object property added (domain `members:Committee`, range `skos:Concept`). Committee type individuals `:SelectCommitteeType`, `:JointCommitteeType`, `:SpecialCommitteeType` added as `eli-dl:ProcessType` + `skos:Concept` members of `:CommitteeTypeTable`. URI pattern convention for committee instances annotated on `members:Committee`.
>
> **member.json alignment (2026):** Six person-level datatype properties added on `:Member`: `:memberCode`, `:pId`, `:gender` (plain `xsd:string`), `:dateOfDeath` (`xsd:dateTime`), `:wikiTitle`, `:hasImage` (`xsd:boolean`). `:hasCommitteePurpose` object property added (domain `members:Committee`, range `skos:Concept`, range from `:CommitteePurposeTable`). Purpose concept individuals `:PolicyPurpose` and `:ShadowDepartmentPurpose` added as `skos:Concept` members of `:CommitteePurposeTable`. `members:Committee` annotation updated to reference both `:hasCommitteeType` and `:hasCommitteePurpose`.

#### Classes

| Class | Superclass(es) | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `:Oireachtas` | `org:FormalOrganization` | The Houses of the Oireachtas as a legislative body |
| `:House` | `:Oireachtas` | Dáil Éireann or Seanad Éireann as a continuous constitutional institution, persisting across successive terms. Named individuals `<.../house/dail>` and `<.../house/seanad>` are instances. Committee chambers are also instances. |
| `:HouseTerm` | `:Oireachtas` | A bounded parliamentary sitting period. Instances should additionally be typed as `eli-dl:ParliamentaryTerm` to enable use of `eli-dl:parliamentary_term` on activities and works. |
| `:DailTerm` | `:HouseTerm` | A specific numbered term of Dáil Éireann (e.g. the 33rd Dáil). Disjoint with `:SeanadTerm`. |
| `:SeanadTerm` | `:HouseTerm` | A specific numbered term of Seanad Éireann. |
| `:Government` | `:Oireachtas` | The Government as defined by Article 28 of the Constitution — the collective executive body with legal personality. Also known informally as the Cabinet (`skos:altLabel "Cabinet"`). Membership confined to persons holding a `members:CabinetMember` role (`members:Taoiseach`, `members:Tanaiste` or `members:Minister`). |
| `:Member` | `foaf:Person` | A Member of one of the Houses. Canonical class replacing the former `members:Member`. `foaf:Person` is the direct superclass — satisfies ELI-DL `eli:Person` range entailment via `eli:Person rdfs:subClassOf foaf:Person`. |
| `:Minister` | `:Member` | A Member who also holds a ministerial office. Cross-referenced to `members:MinisterRole` via `org:holds` / `org:heldBy` bridge axioms in `members.owl`. |
| `:PrivateMember` | `:Member` | A Member who is not a Member of Government |
| `:PrivateSponsor` | `foaf:Agent` | A non-Member person or body that introduces legislation. `foaf:Agent` is the common FOAF supertype of `foaf:Person` (individual sponsors) and `foaf:Organization` (corporate bodies). |

#### Eliminated classes

| Former class | Reason | Replacement |
|---|---|---|
| `:BillSource` | Submitter type is expressed via `eli-dl:was_submitted_by` (Process → Agent) | Use `eli-dl:was_submitted_by` on `eli-dl:LegislativeProcess` instances |
| `:Mover` | Activity-level participation is expressed via `eli-dl:Participation` + `eli-dl:ParticipationRole` | Use `eli-dl:had_participation` with `:MoverRole` (defined in `members.owl`) |

| `:gender` | `:Member` | `xsd:string` | Gender as reported by the API; plain string literal |
| `:dateOfDeath` | `:Member` | `xsd:dateTime` | Date of death where known; `xsd:dateTime` used for OWL 2 DL compatibility |
| `:wikiTitle` | `:Member` | `xsd:string` | Wikipedia article title; can be used to construct a Wikipedia or DBpedia URI |
| `:hasImage` | `:Member` | `xsd:boolean` | `true` if the API has an image available; presence flag only, not a URI |

#### Annotations on imported properties

| Property | Annotation |
|---|---|
| `eli:passed_by` | Range restricted to `:Oireachtas` |
| `eli-dl:was_submitted_by` | Documents that range includes `:Government`, `:PrivateMember`, `:PrivateSponsor`; replaces `:BillSource` |
| `eli-dl:had_participation` | Documents use with `:MoverRole` / `:RapporteurRole` on `:JournalEvent` activities; replaces `:Mover` |

### members.owl

**IRI:** `https://data.oireachtas.ie/ontology/members`

Defines the detailed membership, role and party structures of the Houses of the Oireachtas. Covers Deputies, Senators, Cabinet membership, committee membership, party groupings and parliamentary titles.

> **ELI-DL alignment (2026):** `eli-dl` import added. `org:Role rdfs:subClassOf :OireachtasMember` axiom corrected to `:OireachtasMember rdfs:subClassOf org:Role`. `:MoverRole` and `:RapporteurRole` added as `eli-dl:ParticipationRole` individuals.
>
> **Namespace reconciliation (2026, in progress):** `members.owl` now imports `agents.owl`. The `members:Member` class has been eliminated — all references replaced with `agents:Member` (the canonical class). `members:Government` (whip side) resolved by rename — see three-tier Government refactoring note below. Remaining duplicates (Minister person vs role, HousesOfTheOireachtas) are unresolved — see [Future Work](#future-work--namespace-reconciliation) below.
>
> **House / HouseTerm refactoring (2026):** `members:Chamber` renamed to `members:House`. One-way bridge `members:House rdfs:subClassOf agents:House` added. `members:Dail` and `members:Seanad` gain `agents:DailTerm` and `agents:SeanadTerm` as additional superclasses respectively. `:DailMembership` and `:SeanadMembership` added as disjoint subclasses of `:OireachtasMembership`. `:inHouseTerm` property added (range `agents:HouseTerm`) alongside the re-ranged `:isOireachtasMembershipOf` (range `agents:House`). `Deputy owl:disjointWith Senator` removed from person level; disjointness now expressed via `DailMembership owl:disjointWith SeanadMembership`. Spurious `:Dail` and `:Seanad` superclasses removed from `:DailConstituency` and `:SeanadPanel` respectively.
>
> **Government three-tier refactoring (2026):** `members:Government` (whip side) renamed to `members:GovernmentBenches`. Former vestigial `members:Cabinet` class (incorrectly a subclass of the whip side) removed — the constitutional Cabinet is `agents:Government`. Three tiers now defined: (1) `agents:Government` — constitutional executive body, membership confined to `members:CabinetMember` role-holders (TaoiseachRole, TanaisteRole, MinisterRole); (2) `members:GovernmentExecutive` — Government plus `members:MinisterOfStateRole` role-holders; (3) `members:GovernmentBenches` — GovernmentExecutive plus other OireachtasMembers under the government whip. `members:MinisterOfStateRole` and `members:MinisterOfStateMembership` added; `MinisterOfStateRole owl:disjointWith CabinetMember`. `:isHeadOf` and `:isDeputyHeadOf` re-ranged to `agents:Government`. Four sub-properties added: `:isHeadOfExecutive`, `:isHeadOfBenches` (sub-properties of `:isHeadOf`, domain `:TaoiseachRole`) and `:isDeputyHeadOfExecutive`, `:isDeputyHeadOfBenches` (sub-properties of `:isDeputyHeadOf`, domain `:TanaisteRole`) to assert headship at each wider tier. `:PartyInGovernment` allValuesFrom updated to `members:GovernmentBenches`.
>
> **Role class rename (2026):** All four `members` role classes renamed for unambiguous person/role distinction: `members:Minister` → `members:MinisterRole`, `members:Taoiseach` → `members:TaoiseachRole`, `members:Tanaiste` → `members:TanaisteRole`, `members:MinisterOfState` → `members:MinisterOfStateRole`. `org:holds` / `org:heldBy` bridge axioms added in `members.owl` connecting `agents:Minister` (person) ↔ `members:MinisterRole` (role). `rdfs:comment` added to `agents:Minister` cross-referencing the bridge.
>
> **bill.json alignment (2026):** `:isPrimarySponsor` datatype property (`xsd:boolean`) added on `eli-dl:Participation` to capture the `sponsors[].sponsor.isPrimary` flag. Set `true` on the primary sponsor's participation instance.
>
> **member.json alignment (2026):** `:DeputyChair` class added (`org:Role` subclass, companion to `:Chair`). `:hasCommitteeRole` object property added on `:CommitteeMembership` (range `org:Role`) to record the role a member holds within a committee. `:partyCode`, `:representCode`, `:committeeCode` (all `xsd:string`) and `:committeeID` (`xsd:integer`) datatype properties added for API short-code identifiers on `:PartyGrouping`, `:Constituencies` and `:Committee` respectively. `:officeNameUri` object property added on `:MinisterOfStateMembership` to link to the dereferenceable office IRI when provided by the API.

---

### Future Work

| Item | Description |
|---|---|
| ~~RDA usage — `:PrivateSponsor`~~ | **Resolved (2026).** `rda:C10004` and `rda:C10005` replaced with `foaf:Agent` on `agents:PrivateSponsor`. The RDA namespace (`http://rdaregistry.info/Elements/c/`) is no longer referenced anywhere in the ontology. `rda:` row removed from Referenced External Schemas. |
| Named individual IRI path | Decide whether continuous-house individual IRIs use the short form `<https://data.oireachtas.ie/house/dail>` (current) or the API-path form `<https://data.oireachtas.ie/ie/oireachtas/house/dail>`. Relevant only when the data conversion layer is built. |
| Committee operational lifespan | Add `:hasCommitteeDateRange` property on `:Committee` to record the committee's own operational date range (`committee.committeeDateRange`), distinct from the member's `memberDateRange` already covered by `:hasMembershipDateRange`. |
| Committee lifecycle status | Add `CommitteeStatusTable` concept scheme with members `Active` / `Archived` / etc. to map `committee.status` and `committee.mainStatus` fields. |
| Committee expiry type | Add `CommitteeExpiryTable` concept scheme with members `Sessional` / `Special` etc. to map `committee.expiryType`. |
| Committee time-bounded names | `committee.committeeName` is an array of names each with a validity `dateRange`. Modelling this requires a reification pattern — e.g. a `:CommitteeName` class with `:nameEn`, `:nameGa` and `:hasMembershipDateRange`. Architecturally non-trivial; deferred. |
| Named ministerial office individuals | `office.officeName.uri` currently mapped via bare IRI link (`:officeNameUri`). A future extension could define typed named individuals for each ministerial office (portfolio + department), enabling richer querying. |

### events.owl

**IRI:** `https://data.oireachtas.ie/ontology/events`

Defines the procedural events that occur during a Bill's lifecycle, including stages, delivery methods and outcomes.

> **bill.json alignment (2026):** `:progressStage` and `:stageNo` datatype properties added to represent the cross-house stage ordering integer and per-house amendment list stage number respectively. `:Published` and `:Enacted` named individuals added to the `BillEventTable` concept scheme to cover the `bill.events[]` lifecycle events.
>
> **Correction (Feb 2026):** `:mostRecentStage` removed — duplicated `eli-dl:latest_activity`. `eli-dl:latest_activity` is now annotated in `legislation.owl` for Oireachtas usage (maps to `bill.mostRecentStage`).

#### Classes

| Class | Superclass(es) | Description |
|---|---|---|

Instance data for stage occurrences should follow the same dual-typing pattern. |
| `:commenced` | `time:TemporalEntity` | `:EventDate` | |
| `:elected` | `time:TemporalEntity` | `:EventDate` | |

### legislation.owl

**IRI:** `https://data.oireachtas.ie/ontology/legislation`

Defines the legislative documents published by the Oireachtas, including Bills, Acts, versions, expressions, formats and statuses.

> **ELI-DL migration (2026):** All local subclasses have been eliminated. Each is now replaced by the appropriate ELI-DL or ELI class used directly. The local `metalex` import has been replaced by `eli-dl`. The `:OriginalTitle` data property has been removed in favour of `dct:alternative`.
>
> **bill.json alignment (2026):** `:dateSigned` (sub-property of `eli:date_document`) added for presidential signature date. `:statuteBookURI` (sub-property of `dct:relation`) added for Irish Statute Book cross-references. `:hasAmendmentListType` property and `:NumberedAmendmentList` / `:UnnumberedAmendmentList` individuals added. `:Errata` and `:Gluais` resource type individuals added. `dct:modified` annotated for API record update timestamps.
>
> **Corrections and additions (Feb 2026):** `:hasBillType` removed — replaced by `eli-dl:process_type`; `:PublicBill` and `:PrivateBill` retyped as `eli-dl:ProcessType`. `:originHouse` object property added (domain `eli-dl:DraftLegislationWork`, range `:House`) for bill house of introduction. `:legislativeYear` datatype property added (`xsd:integer`) for the year component of `eli:id_local`. Six `eli-dl`/ELI property annotations added: `eli-dl:process_number`, `eli:id_local`, `eli-dl:process_status`, `eli:type_document`, `eli-dl:process_type`, `eli-dl:latest_activity`.

#### Eliminated local classes — use ELI-DL/ELI equivalents directly

| Former class | Direct replacement | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `:BillResource` | `eli-dl:DraftLegislationWork` | Use `eli:type_document :Bill` to distinguish bills |
| `:BillExpression` | `eli:LegalExpression` | No Oireachtas-specific properties were defined |
| `:BillFormat` | `eli:Format` | No Oireachtas-specific properties were defined |
| `:BillVersion` | `eli-dl:LegislativeProcessWorkVersion` | Version individuals retyped accordingly |
| `:BillsBook` | `skos:OrderedCollection` | Labels belong on instances |
| `:AmendmentList` | `eli-dl:AmendmentToDraftLegislationWork` | ELI-DL supports amendment lists via `eli-dl:has_part` |
| `:BillAmendment` | `eli-dl:AmendmentToDraftLegislationWork` (document) + `eli-dl:LegislativeActivity` (event) | Linked via `eli-dl:created_a_realization_of` |
| `:BillStatus` | `eli-dl:ProcessStatus` | Status individuals retyped accordingly |

#### Annotations on ELI Properties

| Property | Annotation |
|---|---|
| `eli:title_alternative` | `rdfs:label "Long title of a Bill"` |
| `eli:title` | `rdfs:label "Short title of a Bill"` |
| `eli:basis_for` | `rdfs:comment "A Bill is the basis for an Act"` |
| `dct:modified` | Timestamp of last API record update; applied to `eli-dl:DraftLegislationWork` instances (`xsd:dateTime`) |
| `eli-dl:process_number` | For Oireachtas bills: bill/act number component of `eli:id_local` (e.g. `"60"`); maps `billNo` / `actNo` |
| `eli:id_local` | For Oireachtas bills: full compound identifier (e.g. `"2025/60"`); year via `:legislativeYear`, number via `eli-dl:process_number` |
| `eli-dl:process_status` | `stages[].stageOutcome "Enacted"` maps here as `:EnactedBill`, not a `BillEventOutcome`; final stage completion via `eli-dl:activity_completed true` |
| `eli:type_document` | Work-level only (`DraftLegislationWork` or `LegalResource`); `versions[].docType = "act"` signals an Act `eli:LegalResource` |
| `eli-dl:process_type` | Set to `:PublicBill` or `:PrivateBill`; replaces removed `:hasBillType` |
| `eli-dl:latest_activity` | Maps to `bill.mostRecentStage`; replaces removed `:mostRecentStage` (see `events.owl`) |

#### Object Properties

| Property | Domain | Range | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `:hasAmendmentListType` | `eli-dl:AmendmentToDraftLegislationWork` | `skos:Concept` | Numbered or unnumbered list type, drawn from `:AmendmentListTypeTable` |
| `:originHouse` | `eli-dl:DraftLegislationWork` | `:House` | House where the Bill was first introduced; distinct from `eli-dl:was_submitted_by` (submitting agent) |
| `:statuteBookURI` | `eli:LegalResource` | `rdfs:Resource` | Cross-reference to the Irish Statute Book ELI URI; sub-property of `dct:relation` |

#### Datatype Properties

| Property | Domain | Range | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `:dateSigned` | `eli:LegalResource` | `xsd:dateTime` | Presidential signature date and time (Article 25); sub-property of `eli:date_document` |
| `:legislativeYear` | `eli-dl:DraftLegislationWork` / `eli:LegalResource` | `xsd:integer` | Year component of `eli:id_local`; covers `billYear` and `actYear` JSON fields |

#### Named Individuals — ELI Resource Types

`Act`, `Bill`, `DraftBill` (Heads of Bill), `ExplanatoryMemo`, `Errata`, `Gluais`

#### Named Individuals — ELI-DL Process Types (`:BillTypeTable`)

`:PublicBill`, `:PrivateBill` — typed `eli-dl:ProcessType`; members of `:BillTypeTable`. Used via `eli-dl:process_type` on `eli-dl:LegislativeProcess` instances.

#### Named Individuals — Amendment List Types

`NumberedAmendmentList`, `UnnumberedAmendmentList` — typed `skos:Concept`; members of `:AmendmentListTypeTable`.

#### Named Individuals — Bill Versions

Retyped as `eli-dl:LegislativeProcessWorkVersion`: `AsInitiated`, `VersionA` (2nd printing), `VersionB` (3rd), `VersionC` (4th), `VersionD` (5th)

All remain in `eli:VersionTable` via `skos:inScheme`.

#### Named Individuals — Bill Statuses

Retyped as `eli-dl:ProcessStatus`: `AwaitingSignatureBill`, `CurrentBill`, `DefeatedBill`, `DraftHeadsOfBill`, `EnactedBill`, `LapsedBill`, `RejectedAtReferendumBill`, `SubjectToReferendumBill`, `WithdrawnBill`

### JSON-to-Ontology Mapping

Field-level mappings between Oireachtas API JSON responses and ontology terms are recorded in CSV files. Each row maps one JSON field to its ontology term, with notes on IRI patterns, range types and caveats.

#### Columns

| Column | Description |
|---|---|
| `json_path` | Full dot-notation path to the field, using `[]` to denote array elements |
| `json_field` | Leaf field name |
| `ontology_term` | Prefixed ontology term (`eli:`, `eli-dl:`, `:`, `agents:`, `members:`, `foaf:`, `skos:`, etc.) |
| `term_type` | `Class`, `ObjectProperty`, `DatatypeProperty`, `AnnotationProperty`, or `Individual` |
| `source_file` | The `.ttl` sub-ontology file in which the term is defined |
| `mapping_status` | See status values below |
| `notes` | Mapping rationale, range types, IRI patterns and caveats |

#### Mapping status values

| Status | Meaning |

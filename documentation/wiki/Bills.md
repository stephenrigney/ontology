A Bill is a proposed law which, after a formal process of deliberation by the Oireachtas, may or may not eventually be enacted after being passed by the Oireachtas and signed by the President, at which stage it becomes an Act.

In this ontology, Bills are described as ``legislative documents`` and as ``journal events``, corresponding to the Bill as a text document and to the procedures which give a Bill its legal standing, respectively.

### Bills as legislative documents

As a legislative document, a Bill is described using the ELI [(European Legislative Identifier)](http://data.europa.eu/eli/ontology) Work / Expression / Format model. In this model, a Bill is created as an individual intellectual work (`eli:DraftLegislationWork`), expressed as a series of language-specific versions during its lifecycle (`eli:LegalExpression`), and manifested in a physical format such as a PDF or XML file (`eli:Format`).

The Bill as legislative document is also associated with certain metadata, such as its sponsor (via `eli-dl:was_submitted_by`), dates of publication and enactment, and the Act it became, if relevant.


#### Bill document URI patterns

### Bills as journal events

In addition to their existence as documents, Bills are subjects of procedural events recorded in the Order Paper and Official Report. In the ontology each such event is an instance of `oir:BillEvent` (subclass of `eli-dl:LegislativeActivity`). The sequence of events constitutes an `eli-dl:LegislativeProcess` for the bill, typed via `eli-dl:process_type` as either `:PublicBill` or `:PrivateBill`.

Key ELI-DL properties on `eli-dl:LegislativeProcess`:
- `eli-dl:process_type` — bill type (`:PublicBill` / `:PrivateBill`)
- `eli-dl:was_submitted_by` — bill source (`agents:Government`, `agents:PrivateMember`, `agents:PrivateSponsor`)
- `eli-dl:latest_activity` — most recent stage
- `eli-dl:parliamentary_term` — the Dáil or Seanad term

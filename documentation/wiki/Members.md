## Ontology of Houses, Constituencies, Parties, Members and Member Roles

> **2026 update:** Substantial refactoring. `agents:Chamber` renamed to `agents:House`; `members:Cabinet` eliminated; three-tier Government model introduced; member class hierarchy restructured; `metalex:` and `rda:` superclasses removed. See the [ontology README](https://github.com/Oireachtas/ontology/blob/master/ontology/README.md) for the authoritative class and property reference. Further detail on the House/HouseTerm split is in [house_model.md](../house_model.md).
>
> For constitutional structures (Houses, Government tiers, Committees) and bill submitter/participation roles see also [Agents](Agents).

The [Organisation](https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-org/) ontology is extensively reused to model the organisational and temporal components of the Houses of the Oireachtas, Members of the Houses and the roles they play, including in ministerial and committee positions.

### [Houses of the Oireachtas](#houses)

The modelling deliberately separates two distinct concepts of a "House":

- **The permanent institution** (`agents:House`) — Dáil Éireann or Seanad Éireann as a continuous constitutional body persisting across elections. Named individuals `<https://data.oireachtas.ie/house/dail>` and `<https://data.oireachtas.ie/house/seanad>` are the identifiers. Parliamentary committees are also `agents:House` instances.
- **A numbered sitting** (`agents:HouseTerm`) — a bounded parliamentary period, e.g. the 33rd Dáil (2020–2025). Subclasses `agents:DailTerm` and `agents:SeanadTerm` exist. Each `HouseTerm` is additionally typed `eli-dl:ParliamentaryTerm` so it can be referenced via `eli-dl:parliamentary_term` on activities and works.

The temporal date range (commencement and dissolution) is modelled via `dct:temporal` / `dct:PeriodOfTime` with `dcat:startDate` and `dcat:endDate`. See [mapping_notes.md](../mapping_notes.md) for a worked example.

#### [House URI patterns](#house-uri)

```
https://data.oireachtas.ie/house/dail                          — permanent Dáil institution
https://data.oireachtas.ie/house/seanad                        — permanent Seanad institution
https://data.oireachtas.ie/ie/oireachtas/house/dail/{no}       — a numbered Dáil term
https://data.oireachtas.ie/ie/oireachtas/house/seanad/{no}     — a numbered Seanad term
```

#### [House and HouseTerm classes](#house-class)

| Class | Superclass(es) | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `agents:Oireachtas` | `org:FormalOrganization` | The Houses of the Oireachtas as a legislative body |
| `agents:House` | `agents:Oireachtas` | Dáil or Seanad as a continuous constitutional institution; committees also typed here |

#### [House properties](#house-property)

| Property | Domain | Range | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `:hasTerm` | `agents:House` | `agents:HouseTerm` | `owl:inverseOf :termOf` |
| `:termOf` | `agents:HouseTerm` | `agents:House` | Links a term back to its persistent house |
| `:termNo` | `agents:HouseTerm` | `xsd:integer` | Sequential number (e.g. `34`) |
| `:houseCode` | `agents:HouseTerm` | `xsd:string` | E.g. `"dail"`, `"seanad"` |
| `:seats` | `agents:HouseTerm` | `xsd:integer` | Seat count for this term |
| `dct:temporal` | `agents:HouseTerm` | `dct:PeriodOfTime` | Links to a date range node with `dcat:startDate` / `dcat:endDate` |
| `skos:prefLabel` | `agents:HouseTerm` | `xsd:string` | E.g. `"34th Dáil"@en` |

### [Government structure](#government)

The Government is modelled across three tiers to reflect both constitutional and parliamentary realities:

| Tier | Class | Description |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `agents:Government` | The constitutional executive body (Article 28). Membership confined to `members:CabinetMember` role-holders (Taoiseach, Tánaiste, Ministers). |
| 2 | `members:GovernmentExecutive` | `agents:Government` plus `members:MinisterOfStateRole` holders. |
| 3 | `members:GovernmentBenches` | `members:GovernmentExecutive` plus other OireachtasMembers under the government whip. Replaces the former `members:Government` (whip side). |

The former `members:Cabinet` class (a subclass of the whip side — architecturally incorrect) has been eliminated. Use `agents:Government` for the constitutional Cabinet.

Government URI: `<https://data.oireachtas.ie/def/bill-source/government>` — typed `agents:Government`.

#### Role classes

| Class | Superclass(es) | Description |
|---|---|---|

### [Members of the Oireachtas](#members)

Members of the Oireachtas are modelled using `foaf:Person` for biographical details and the Organisation ontology for temporal roles such as Deputy or Senator, minister or committee member.
